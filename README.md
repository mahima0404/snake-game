# Snake Game

This project is a classic **Snake Game** implemented using the **Pygame** library in Python. The game is a fun and engaging way to demonstrate basic game development concepts such as rendering graphics, handling user input, and collision detection.

## Features

- **Simple Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat the food and grow longer.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score in real-time.
- **Collision Detection**: Game ends when the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust game speed, grid size, and colors.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pygame**: A library for building graphical games and handling user input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the game script:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right

3. Avoid colliding with the walls or yourself while trying to eat the food.

## Game Rules

- The snake starts small and grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
- Your score increases with every piece of food consumed.

## Customization

- Modify the game settings in the script:
  - **Game Speed**: Adjust the speed of the snake by changing the frames per second (FPS).
  - **Grid Size**: Change the size of the game grid.
  - **Colors**: Customize the colors of the snake, food, and background.

## Future Improvements

- Add levels with increasing difficulty.
- Include sound effects and background music.
- Implement a high-score leaderboard.
- Support for pausing and resuming the game.
